# Beam Instrumentation Data Processing for ESS DMSC

This Python-based tool is designed for processing HDF5 files generated by the **Beam Instrumentation group** at the **European Spallation Source (ESS)**. The tool extracts datasets and metadata, posts relevant groups to **SciCat**, and visualizes datasets as plots attached to SciCat entries.

The **DMSC (Data Management and Software Centre)** oversees this pipeline, ensuring seamless integration of instrumentation data into the broader data management ecosystem.

## **Features**

- **HDF5 File Parsing**:
  - Reads and parses HDF5 files using the format specified by the Beam Instrumentation group.
  - Refer to the [Data Format Proposal](https://confluence.esss.lu.se/display/BIG/Data+format+proposal) for details.

- **SciCat Integration**:
  - Posts extracted groups and metadata to the SciCat API for cataloging and analysis.

- **Dataset Visualization**:
  - Automatically generates plots from datasets and attaches them as files to corresponding SciCat entries.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing. For deployment, refer to the appropriate deployment section.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following software and libraries are installed:

- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `h5py` for reading HDF5 files.
  - `matplotlib` for generating plots.
  - `requests` for SciCat API interaction.

Install these libraries with:
```bash
pip install h5py matplotlib requests
